## Description

- My motivation for this project was to take on a back-end ORM challenge.
- I learned about ORMs.

## Installation

- Install node.js, psql, pg, express, dotenv, and sequelize.

## Technology Used

- JS

## Usage

- Clone this repository and open with vscode. Right click on the "schema.sql" file in the "db" folder and select "Open with integrated terminal". Once there, type in "psql -U postgres" followed by your password to log in to psql. Input "\i schema.sql" and then find the folder called "server.js" and open that in the integrated terminal too. Once there type in "npm run seed" and you now have access to testing all of the routes in insomnia.
